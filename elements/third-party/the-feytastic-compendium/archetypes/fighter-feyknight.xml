			<p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain some control over the ever-changing magic of the fey. It imbues you and gives you an edge in battle. Choose one of the following powers:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Stealthy.</em></strong> After using your action on a turn, you can use your bonus action to become invisible, this effect lasts until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ephemeral.</em></strong> You can use your bonus action to teleport up to 30 feet closer to an enemy creature.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Beguiling.</em></strong> As an action, you target one humanoid or beast that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the target can see you it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier), or be magically charmed. It does so with advantage if it is hostile to you, or you or yyour companions are fighting it.</p>
			<p class="indent">The charmed creature regards you as a trusted friend to bee heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under your control, it takes your requests or actions in the most favourable way it can. Each time you or your allies do anything harmful to the target, or ask to perform an action that would be harmful to it, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 10 minutes or until you end the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to this ability for the next 24 hours.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p class="indent"> You can use the powers granted by this ability a number of time equal to your Charisma modifier + 2 per long rest. You can change which power you can use as part of a short or long rest.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p class="centre"> Your Charisma score also increases by 2.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 3rd level, as an action, you can touch a creature and magically know the creature's current emotional state. If a target fails a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma Modifier), you can also learn the creature's alignment, and if the last sentence they said was a truth or a lie.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ephemeral.</em></strong> You can touch another willing creature to bring it with you when you teleport, and aren't restricted to teleporting towards an enemy.</p>
