			<p>Monks of the Way of the Floral Soul seek physical and spiritual perfection through their connection with the nature around them, which changes the way that their Ki behaves and sometimes even the monk's personality. Few are the ones who attune themselves with their environment in this unique way, generally they have some natural connection with the Feywild so much so that this monastic tradition was first developed by Spring Eladrins after they started rooting themselves into civilizations and meeting with monks in the material plane. Way of the Floral Soul monks focuses primarily on versatility, even taking some druidic abilities in their favour and manifesting their Ki energy with semi corporeal flowers, which can be just as deadly as they are beautiful.</p>

			<p>Starting at the third level when you adopt this tradition you can manifest part of the nature within your own soul. By expending 1 Ki point and a bonus action you can take one of these forms for 1 minute:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Aspect of the Lotus.</em></strong> You gain advantage on all Performance checks and you can cast the cantrip Shillelagh to empower your unarmed strikes. In addition you can use the ability <b>Dance of Petals:</b> you create a gentle rain of lotus petals that fall around you. On the first hit against a hostile creature on your turn you can force it to make a wisdom saving throw against your monk DC, on a failed save that creature will have disadvantage on the first attack it makes against you until the end of your next turn, you also can spend 1 Ki point to heal a creature within 10 feet of you for a amount equal to your martial arts die + your wisdom modifier. When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the unarmed strikes with a use of this feature without spending a Ki point for the healing.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Aspect of the Rose.</em></strong> You gain an advantage on all Deception rolls. In addition you can use the ability <b>Rose's Thorn:</b> You create semi corporeal vines around your body, these vines can be extended up to 30 feet and use it harmlessly on a creature or object to pull or grab them. Your attacks also gain an increased range of up to 10 feet, they deal Piercing instead of Bludgeoning damage and your martial arts die increases by 1 in damage class (becoming 1d6 if it's 1d4, etc). You can also use a bonus action to grab an object and move up to 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Aspect of the Orchid.</em></strong> You gain advantage on all Intimidation/Persuasion rolls depending on which orchid type you choose. In addition you can use the ability <b>Floral Adaptation:</b> as different kinds of orchids sprout from the surface of your body you can empower yourself depending on what you want in the moment. Choose one of orchid from the adaptation table below and gain resistance against its respective damage type you've bonded to, you also deal 1d4 of the chosen damage type on all melee weapon attacks and unarmed strikes, this damage rises to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 17th level.</p>

			<p>Finally at Level 17 you learned to manipulate your Ki and become one with the environment around you. If you spend at least 30 minutes meditating in direct contact with an ecosystem, you can discover every type of vegetation and the location of all the wildlife inherent of that place within a radius of 50 kilometres. In addition, your Ability given by Blossom gains the following increments:</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Lotus Incarnation</em></strong></p>
			<p class="indent">When an enemy fails to resist your <b>Dance of the Petals</b> ability it automatically misses the first attack it makes against you, and the first attack   it makes against a creature other than you has a disadvantage. Additionally you can spend 7 Ki points to replicate the effect of the Heal Spell Without the need for spell components. you can only replicate this effect 3 times a day.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Rose Incarnation</em></strong></p>
			<p class="indent">When you use Flurry of Blows while <b>Rose's Thorn</b> is active you make 3 unarmed strikes instead of 2. Also when you grab an object to move towards it you don't generate attacks of opportunity, the range goes up to 45 feet and you can perform an unarmed strike on a creature up to 10 feet from where you stopped with your movement.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Orchid Incarnation</em></strong></p>
			<p class="indent">While <b>Floral Adaptation</b> is active and you use your Floral Protection or Diamond Soul abilities you cause the energy within you to Burst, forcing all hostile creatures in an area of 20 feet centred on you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your Monk DC, on a failed save they take 3d8 damage from the element you are bound to. Also when you roll 1 or 2 on the elemental damage for your attacks you can reroll and must use the new value, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>About the Nature's Herald Usage</strong></p>
			<p class="indent"><em>This is a situational, high level feature. Is important to have in mind that if there is any kind of creature or plant that the players may be Interested on that level of play, the DM must be prepared to describe the most important details to avoid unnecessary work. On the other hand, if the player want to have a general idea of their surroundings the DM can give a rounded explanation of the biosphere they are inserted forgoing superfluous descriptions.</em></p>
